# Fit-Generation

In this project, Stephen Smith software developer was granted appproval by the Nashville Software School for a front-end Capestone. The goal, to build an application that will provide people with fitness tools and information, and generate personalized workout programs based on user criteria. This project was my first solo sprint front-end application, where I created both UI and styling...aswell as used API data in addition to creating my own local database-API(fit-generation-API which is saved in its own repository https://github.com/SAS7178/Fit-Generation-API).
