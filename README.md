# Fit-Generation

In this project, Stephen Smith was by the Nashville Software School(Capestone) to build an application that will provide people with fitness tools and information, and generate personalized workout programs based on user criteria. This project was my first solo sprint front-end application, where I created both UI and styling...aswell as used API data and my own local databaseAPI.
